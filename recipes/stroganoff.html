    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package egg noodles</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 (4.5 ounce) can sliced mushrooms, drained (Optional)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon garlic salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 5 minutes; drain.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Saute onion in hot butter until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add ground beef to skillet in small chunks; cook and stir to break the beef into smaller pieces as it cooks until no longer pink, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle flour over the beef mixture, stir, and cook for 1 minute. Stir mushrooms and garlic salt into the beef mixture. Pour mushroom soup and chicken soup over beef, stir, and cook until hot, about 5 minutes; add sour cream, stir until smooth, and cook until again hot, 2 to 3 minutes more. Pour beef mixture over the cooked egg noodles.</li>
    </ol>
